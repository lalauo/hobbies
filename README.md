# hobbies

1. Even though it's more of a new career path than a hobby, something I'm spending lots of time doing these days is learning to code, learning how to use the command line, and how to use Git and GitHub.
2. I'm also going to start roller skating lessons soon. That's something I've wanted to get good at for so long, but I never really had the confidence to out on alone and practice.
3. I also want to sew trousers. I started a pattern cutting course which will hopefully teach me the techniques required.
